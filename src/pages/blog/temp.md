As developers, we stare at code all day. Making sure that code is presented in a legible and clear format is a table of stakes for productive coding. What are some great monospaced fonts aimed at displaying code?

###**[Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)**

This font comes with font ligatures as well as “semi-connected cursive italics”. Some developers prefer to customize their IDE’s to display comments in this cursive style as a way of differentiating the text from code.

###**[Ubuntu Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono?preview.text_type=custom)**

Ubuntu Mono is a monospaced typeface commissioned by Canonical (creators of Ubuntu Linux) to complement the look and feel of their Linux distribution.

###**[Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles)**

Another free font with font ligatures designed for a great coding experience.

###**[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)**

It’s incredibly easy to get started with and incorporate with VS Code, and includes some pretty sweet font ligatures!

###**[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)**

This one is built by Source Foundry and the demo page does a wonderful job explaining its benefits.

###**[Input](https://input.djr.com/)**

Input is only free for private use so you won’t be able to use it to style code blocks on your website, but it looks pretty great in your IDE.

###**[Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)**

Source Code Pro was designed “to work well in user interface (UI) environments”, and the designer also created a sans-serif companion font “Source Sans.”

###**[Anonymous Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro?preview.text_type=custom)**

Anonymous Pro is designed as a coding font with a few specific improvements over others in mind: Characters that could be mistaken for each other like 0 (zero) vs O (capital O) are intentionally differentiated, and the font is built to work well down to very small sizes.

All fonts were chosen only if they were Monospaced and also were free to use on all types of systems.
